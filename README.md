This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict and analyze human personality traits based on various inputs. The goal is to provide an intuitive model that can accurately predict personality types by analyzing patterns in behavior, preferences, and responses.

Features:
Data Collection: The project utilizes datasets that contain behavioral traits, responses to personality quizzes, and demographic information.
Machine Learning Model: Various classification algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, are used to predict personality traits such as openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism based on input data.
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed with techniques like feature scaling, missing value handling, and encoding categorical variables to ensure optimal model performance.
Evaluation: The model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable predictions.
Technologies Used:
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib (for data visualization)
Vscode
